Welcome to Multi2sim 5.0

Multi2sim is a simulator of CPUs and GPUs, used to test and validate new hardware designs before
they are physically manufactured. By running a set of standard benchmarks on Multi2Sim, a computer
architect can verify whether a proposed alternative design is correct, and what its relative
performance is over existing designs.

Multi2sim 5.0 code is maintained in Github, and TopOfTrees (www.topoftrees.com).
We use Github reporting bugs and issuing requests.
We use TopOfTrees as a forum for discussions, code review, and development. TopOfTrees implements
the Agile software development Model.

Installation:

In order to install Multi2sim on Ubuntu 14.04 and 15.04 run the following commands:

$> libtoolize
$> aclocal
$> autoconf
$> automake --add-missing
$> ./configure
$> make

For other platforms such as Mac OS and Windows (and for now, Ubuntu 16.04) you can use our up to
date image on docker. For that you require to have docker installed on your machine. 
The instructions to install docker can be found in: https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/

After installing the docker, you can pull the image of the Multi2sim's master branch with the
following command:

(in the docker terminal)
$> docker pull multi2sim/multi2sim

$> docker run -it multi2sim/multi2sim bash

The head of the master branch of Multi2sim 5.0 is automatically compiled and installed on the 
filesystem of the downloaded image, and you can simply run Multi2sim:

$> m2s
