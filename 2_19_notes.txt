--- ISA Choice
	Basic Arithmetic (cmov, abckwards branches, loads+stores)
	merged basic block (osort, oarray, oshuffle, oiterator)
--- Evaluation Benchmarks
	Show that expensive routines are less expensive (oram, sort)
	Show that programs are efficient as circuits
	Some realistic programs for the tax calculator

Week 1-3:
	Implement benchmarks, consider ISA choices
		

Baselines:
	non-oblivious
	insecure oblivious (vanilla cmovs)
	risc oblivious ISA
	risc + cisc oblivious ISA	
secure cmov? why even need oshuffle?
elaborate more on ISA choice?
